      The rating percentage is calculated from customers who booked within the last 6 months. All
      ratings and reviews are based on the feedback and opinions of the customers who submitted them
      and do not express the opinions of Hostelworld.com. This way, you get an up-to-the-minute
      opinion of just how good a hostel really is.
